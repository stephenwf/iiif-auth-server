Generate manifests from the media_auth_config file too

"Login" screen templates for interactive profiles - logins and clickthroughs and other things.
Do some silly examples, too.

Don't need "open" - absence of auth does this too. But still have max.

Put w,h,d on all media.

For the pattern of a static image with an image service, where both must be authed, the info.json of the image service is the static image's probe service.


Make sure services have the label fields defined in new spec, and don't have ones that are not defined.


 - go through the remaining code. Make sure it all runs. Make sure the flows are OK and that it implements the spec as currently stands.

Friday work on the Wellcome report.
