    This represents the user's interaction with the content provider, to establish a cookie that the token service can see. In practice, anything could be happening in this window. 
    </p><p>
    The user could be redirected to another authentication provider such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, an institutional CAS server or other form of single sign-on. As long as a cookie for the content domain is set and the window closed, anything can happen here.
